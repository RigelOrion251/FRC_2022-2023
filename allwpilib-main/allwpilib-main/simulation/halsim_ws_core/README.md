# HAL WebSockets Core

This is the common WebSockets implementation shared by the [HAL WebSockets Client](../halsim_ws_client/) and [HAL WebSockets Server](../halsim_ws_server/) extensions.  It is not a standalone extension.

These extensions provide a WebSockets API for transmitting robot hardware interface state over a network and implement the [Robot Hardware Interface WebSockets API specification](doc/hardware_ws_api.md).  See the specification for more details on the protocol.
